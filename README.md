# JS Bootcamp Report

## Introduction

This report documents the completion of two tasks as part of a JavaScript Bootcamp. The tasks involved building a Dynamic Calculator and a Weather App. These projects provided practical experience with JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript, and API integration.

## Task 1: Dynamic Calculator

### Overview

The Dynamic Calculator is a fully functional calculator built using JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features

- **User Input**: Users can input numbers and select operations through buttons.
- **Dynamic Display**: The calculator dynamically updates the display as numbers and operations are entered.
- **Error Handling**: The calculator handles invalid operations gracefully.

### Code Highlights

- **Event Listeners**: Used to capture button clicks and update the display.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Updated the calculator display and handled user inputs.
- **Functions**: Encapsulated logic for operations and display updates in functions.

## Task 2: Weather App

### Overview

The Weather App fetches and displays current weather data for a specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API. It demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, and DOM manipulation.

### Features

- **Fetch Weather Data**: Users can enter a city name and get the current weather information.
- **Weather Icons**: Displays relevant weather icons based on the data fetched from the API.
- **Current Date and Time**: Shows the current date and time for the fetched weather data.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for invalid city names or API request failures.

### Code Highlights

- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Used `fetch`, Promises, and `async/await` to handle API requests.
- **Template Literals**: Utilized for building the HTML structure dynamically.
- **Destructuring**: Used to extract values from the API response.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented with `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks.

## Feedback

Completing these tasks has been a great learning experience. The Dynamic Calculator task helped solidify my understanding of basic JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation. The Weather App task provided valuable practice with asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, and error handling.

Both tasks have improved my ability to write clean, modular code and enhanced my understanding of modern JavaScript features like template literals and destructuring. Moving forward, I feel more confident in tackling more complex projects and further expanding my JavaScript skills.


Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this bootcamp. I look forward to applying the skills I have learned in future projects.
