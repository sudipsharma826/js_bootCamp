## Important Terms and Concepts

### API (Application Programming Interface)
An API allows different software applications to communicate with each other. This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

### Asynchronous JavaScript
Allows the program to run other tasks while waiting for an API response, implemented using `fetch`, Promises, and `async/await`.

### DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation
Involves selecting and modifying HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript to update the weather information on the webpage.

### Template Literals
A way to include variables and expressions within strings using backticks (`), allowing for more readable and maintainable code.

### Destructuring
A convenient way of extracting multiple values from arrays or objects into variables. Used to extract weather data from the API response.

### Error Handling
Implemented using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to manage errors that might occur during the API request or other operations.
